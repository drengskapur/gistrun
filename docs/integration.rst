Integration
===========

GistRun can be easily integrated with other tools and scripts, allowing you to automate various tasks involving code snippets or scripts hosted on GitHub Gists.

Continuous Integration and Deployment
-------------------------------------

You can use GistRun in your continuous integration and deployment pipelines to fetch and execute test scripts or deployment scripts directly from Gists. This can be particularly useful for sharing and reusing scripts across different projects or teams.

For example, in your CI/CD pipeline, you can run the following command to execute a test script hosted on a GitHub Gist:

.. code-block:: console

  $ gistrun exec octocat/my-test-script

You can also integrate GistRun with popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, and more.

Scripting and Automation
------------------------

GistRun can be used in combination with other command-line utilities or scripts, enabling you to build more complex workflows and automations around code snippets hosted on GitHub Gists.

For example, you can create a shell script that fetches and executes multiple Gists in a specific order, or you can incorporate GistRun into your existing scripts to dynamically execute code snippets based on certain conditions.

Here's an example shell script that executes multiple Gists:

.. code-block:: bash

  #!/bin/bash

  # Execute a setup script
  gistrun exec octocat/setup-script

  # Execute the main script
  gistrun exec octocat/main-script

  # Execute a cleanup script
  gistrun exec octocat/cleanup-script

By combining GistRun with other scripting languages and tools, you can create powerful and flexible automation solutions tailored to your specific needs.
